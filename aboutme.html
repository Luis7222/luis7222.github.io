					<p>In my professional career, I've had the privilege of working as a Full-Stack Software Engineer at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas since June 2021. In this role, I've been involved in launching multiple public website applications, which have undergone rigorous testing. My responsibilities have encompassed developing front-end APIs using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and Typescript. I've also been deeply involved in creating back-end databases and APIs using MySQL, Java, Kotlin, and JSON. My focus has always been on designing user-friendly interfaces while documenting our daily progress using tools like JIRA and Pivotal Tracker. I've embraced pair programming, ensuring efficient code development and testing via GitHub. Additionally, I've consistently followed Agile methodology, achieving a predictability rate of over 92 percent through sprints. I've also contributed to integration testing with Jest, drawing from my knowledge of traditional app languages such as C, C++, C#, and Java, as well as scripting languages like BASH, PERL, and RUBY. Moreover, I've applied my expertise in mobile technologies (IOS, Android, Java, HTML5), managed service-oriented architecture, harnessed cloud computing technologies (SaaS, IaaS, PaaS), and worked with multiple development methodologies. I've also played a crucial role in system performance management using Cloud Foundry (PCF, Concourse) and adeptly adapted to system changes and configuration management. My interaction with senior Business Analysts to meet business requirements has been instrumental, and I've had the opportunity to train and mentor new Associate Developers across various projects. My commitment to delivering excellence and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in software engineering has defined my journey at Blue Cross Blue Shield.</p>

					<p>Prior to my role at Blue Cross Blue Shield, I served as an IT Technician for The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley from January 2016 to May 2021, primarily focused on Audio/Visual Classroom Support. In this capacity, I became adept at identifying and troubleshooting computer issues, addressing concerns like bad hard drives, viruses/malware-infected systems, and various technical glitches. My responsibilities extended to assisting with the technical aspects of computer, projector, sound system, and document cameras, collaborating with professors, engineers, technicians, vendors, and sales teams to meet installation deadlines, and managing inventory. I also played a pivotal role in updating the inventory management process and trained fellow employees in its use. Additionally, I programmed hardware to seamlessly integrate with Cisco classroom equipment and provided onsite support to professors and students across the entire Edinburg UTRGV campus. My ability to navigate complex technical challenges and provide effective solutions was a hallmark of my tenure.</p>

					<p>My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, which I completed in Spring 2021. Additionally, I obtained two associate degrees in Computer Applications and Web Applications from South Texas College in 2015. My academic foundation has provided me with the knowledge and skills essential for my successful career in software engineering and IT support. </p>
